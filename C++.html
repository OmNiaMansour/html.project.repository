Primarily, C++ was called  'C with classes' since it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of classes. It is an extension of the C programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup that offers a higher-level of abstraction. However, it is still powerful and efficient. C++ is an object-oriented, middle-level programming language. It is possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." Moreover, it can be coded in either way.
