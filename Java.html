James Gosling, Patric Naughton, and Mike Sheridan were the first to initiate the Java language project in 1991. And it initially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to feel similar to C++ but simpler in use. Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with many features that make it perfect for web-based development. It is used for building enterprise-scale web applications widely. Also, it is ideal for distributed computing and highly secure because of the exclusion of explicit pointer and inclusion of a security manager responsible for defining the access of classes.  Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Mac OS, Windows.
