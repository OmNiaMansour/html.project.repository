Python is an advanced, object-oriented language that built on flexible and robust semantics. It first released in 1989. Python is very common for general-purpose programming. Recently, it has become known for use in applications in artificial intelligence. It is easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability. Thus, it reduces the cost of program maintenance.Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, both in addition to interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

Programs written in Python are much shorter than equivalent Java, C, or C++, programs, for many reasons: 
<ul style="font-size:120%;">
<li>The high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement</li>

<li> Statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets</li>

</ul>
